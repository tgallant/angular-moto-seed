# Angular Seed 

Based on [Todd Motto's style guide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide)

Hopefully Angular2 won't kill this :(

## Setup

+ `git clone --depth 1 --branch master git@github.com:tgallant/angular-motto-seed.git <project name>`
+ You need to have postgres and the g++ compiler installed (dependency for bcrypt).
+ Create a DB in postgres for your application and update the db string values in `config/config.js`.
+ `npm install && bower install`
+ `gulp`
+ Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
+ Login with username test and password test.
